### Prediction Of Consumer Credit Risk Using Machine Learning 

The problem at hand is predicting loan eligibility accurately and objectively, which is a critical issue for both individuals and financial institutions. Traditional methods of assessing creditworthiness can be prone to errors and unconscious biases, leading to unfair lending practices. To solve this problem, machine learning can provide more data-driven insights into a borrower's ability to repay a loan by analyzing various factors such as age, income, credit score, loan amount, and employment status. The dataset used for this task includes 1,000 instances with 20 attributes, such as credit history, employment, and installment commitment, which can be collected from various sources. To improve the accuracy of the machine learning model, reliable and accurate data is essential, and data preprocessing techniques such as data cleaning and normalization must be applied. The related tasks include Logistics Regression, Support Vector Machines (RBF), Random Forest Classifier, and K Neighbors Classifier. Ultimately, the goal is to develop a model that can help lenders make informed decisions while ensuring fair and unbiased lending practices.
